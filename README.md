# Notes-Extractor

Notes extractor is an application where we give the path of the images folder, either in mobile or laptop and it segregates the notes' images with other images and stores them in a folder named "notes".

I prepared using the images I had im my mobile over the period of time and segregated manually into 2 folders names "1" representing notes folder and "0" representing others folder and used that data to train the model.

The model consists of three blocks of CNN layers and two fully connected layer and I am able to reach the accuracy of approximately 85%. Further efforts are being made on the project to improve the accuracy of the project.
